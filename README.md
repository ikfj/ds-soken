## For the first time, create your environment

If you have not done so already, please click this button [![Binder](https://binder.cs.rcos.nii.ac.jp/badge_logo.svg)](https://binder.cs.rcos.nii.ac.jp/v2/gh/ikfj/ds-soken/main) once.
Then you will be navigated to your own programming environment with Jupyter Notebook (default) and RStudio (optional).

To use RStudio, please click the [New] button on the top-right corner, then choose RStudio.

When finished, save the edited file and close the browser.
Your environment will not be lost when you close the browser.

> Note: Each time you click the button, a new environment will be created.
> So, if you press this button twice, you will have two environments.
> One student can have a maximum of 20 environments.

If you already have created your environment, visit https://jupyter.cs.rcos.nii.ac.jp/ to reuse it.
You will see a list of environments you have created.
Click on the URL to open the environment and resume your work.
